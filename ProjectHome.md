The **NeuroPsychological Testing Ontology (NPT)** represents neuropsychological assessments such as the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Trail-Making Test, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, and the Wechsler Memory Scale.  NPT is designed to allow for the integration of results from a variety of neuropsychological tests that assay similar measures of cognitive functioning and provides a set of classes for the annotation of neuropsychological testing data.  Neuropsychological testing is an important component in developing the clinical pictures used in the diagnosis of patients with a range of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and following stroke or traumatic brain injury.  An initial goal of the NPT project is to test hypotheses about the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on the results of neuropsychological assessments.

NPT is being built in accordance with the [OBO Foundry principles](http://www.obofoundry.org/crit.shtml).  It is as an extension of the [Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](http://obi-ontology.org/page/Main_Page) (OBI), which utilizes both the [Information Artifact Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/information-artifact-ontology/) (IAO) and the [Basic Formal Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/bfo/) (BFO).  NPT is a corollary project of the [Neurological Disease Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/neurological-disease-ontology/) (ND) and is being developed in collaboration with the developers of the [Mental Functioning Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/mental-functioning-ontology/) (MF).

Below is a partial representation of the MMSE in NPT:

Our paper “[Ontologies for the Study of Neurological Diseases](http://neurological-disease-ontology.googlecode.com/svn/Ontologies%20for%20the%20Study%20of%20Neurological%20Disease%20-%20ICBO%202012%20Paper.pdf)” discusses both NPT and ND.  It was presented at the workshop “[Towards an Ontology of Mental Functioning](http://kr-med.org/icbofois2012/mfo/)” on July 22 during the ICBO 2012: 3rd International Conference on Biomedical Ontology in Graz, Austria.  The slides from this presentation are available here.

There is a [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/neuropsychological-testing-ontology) for discussing the NPT project.  If you are interested in participating in the development of NPT, please send an email to addiehl\_at\_buffalo.edu.
